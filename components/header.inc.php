            <h2>Olympics</h2>

            <p>
            The theme of this project is “The  Website Development  for Analysis of the Olympic Games Data”.
            The Olympics is an international event aimed at improving the mind and body, overcoming various differences 
            such as culture and nationality, and contributing to the realization of a peaceful and better world 
            with a spirit of solidarity and fair play. Many people wait for the Olympic season, 
            and the Olympic Games leave precious memories in the hearts of many. Through the analysis of the related data, 
            we would like to derive new information that is unknown beyond the enjoyable games.
